        <p>
            The dog (Canis familiaris or Canis lupus familiaris) is a domesticated descendant of the wolf. <br>
             Also called the domestic dog, it was domesticated from an extinct population of wolves during the Late Pleistocene, <br>
              over 14,000 years ago by hunter-gatherers, prior to the development of agriculture. The dog was the first species to be domesticated <br>
               by humans. Experts estimate that due to their long association with humans, dogs have expanded to a large number of domestic <br>
                individuals and gained the ability to thrive on a starch-rich diet that would be inadequate for other canids.[4]
                The dog has been selectively bred over millennia for various behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical attributes. <br>
                [5] Dog breeds vary widely in shape, size, and color. They perform many roles for humans, such as hunting, <br>
                 herding, pulling loads, protection, assisting police and the military, companionship, therapy, and aiding disabled people. <br>
                  Over the millennia, dogs became uniquely adapted to human behavior, and the humanâ€“canine bond has been a topic <br>
                   of frequent study. This influence on human society has given them the sobriquet of "man's best friend".
